At most once, at least once, exactly once:

Idempotence is a kafka producer feature and configuration.
enable.Idempotence  = true.

Broker assignes a unique producer id to each producer during
producer-broker handshake.

Producer assignes message-id to each message it sends to broker.
Idempotency is maintained using the sequence id of the messages sent by
producer. 
It is expected to be little slow than a  kafka  setup
without idempotency, as messages with only expected sequence id is accepted
and others are rejected.

Each messages is assigned a unique sequence id.

If a messages is rejected by broker, how does producer handle the scenario?

Is this similar to how packet is transmitted in tcp?
