Download kafka  from confluent.io.
Suprisingly its a java application. I expected it to be 
a container.  
for mac:

brew install zookeeper
starting zookeeper: /usr/local/bin/zkServer start
zookeeper configfile:  /usr/local/etc/zookeeper/zoo.cfg
zookeeper  data  directory: /usr/local/var/run/zookeeper/data/

stop zookeeper:
sudo zookeeper-server-stop 


kafka details:

binaries and scripts: /usr/local/bin/
kafka configuration: /usr/local/etc/kafka
zookeerp configuration: /usr/local/etc/zookeeper
kafka data: /usr/local/var/lib/kafka-logs


brew install kafka 
kafka-server-start /usr/local/etc/kafka/server.properties
