1/ What  are message-queue or task queue?
Ans: Message queue is a system that combines following 5 feature:
1. heart-beat mechanism
2. load balancing
3. Persistence
4. Asynchronous request/response
5. Notifier


2/ When do you use message queue?
ans: 


3/ State one example problem where message-queue can be used?
ans: Multiple pizza shops delivering take away orders. 
If one shop goes down, its orders can be re-routed to other shops if
orders are persisted. Hence persistence is required for reliability.

We need a central dispatcher to re-route orders from failed shops to 
active shops. This dispatcher should load balance orders to all active
shops. Hence load balancing is needed. To only re-route orders from failed node
, consistent hashing is needed. Without consistent hashing, order duplication will happen.
Once dispatched, orders can't be undispatched. It  can only be re-routed in case of a failure.

In db, orders can be persisted using following columns;
|---|-----------|--------|----------- |
|id |  content  | status | server  id |
|---|-----------|--------|----------- |

Once a node becomes inactive, do we need to re-route all the orders using C-hashing
or re-route just orders from inactive node?
--> If we re-route all the orders using consisten-hashing, we dont need to maintain server-id against
order-id.

--> If we re-route only orders from inactive node, we need to maintain server-id and update server-id
if again re-rerouting happens and server-id is changed. Server-id means extra write operation.
