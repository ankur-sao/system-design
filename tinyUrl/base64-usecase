Use case of base64:

Hashes are one-way functions that transform a block of bytes into
another block of bytes of a fixed size such as 128 bits or 256 bits.
Converting the resulting bytes into Base64 makes it easier to displaythe hash especially when you are comparing a checksum for integrity.
Hashes are always seen in Base64 that many people mistake Base64 itself as the hash.

Cryptography:
Since an encryption key does not have to be text but raw bytes,
it  is sometimes necessary to store  it in a file  or database, which
Base64 comes in handy for. Same with the encrypted bytes.

Base64 is not  a security  mechanism. Anyone can convert  Base64
string back to its original bytes, so it should not be used as a
means for protecting data, only as a format to display or store raw bytes more easily.
